## 📂 Project Overview

This webpage was created as part of the **Special Quant Coders (SQC) Induction**. It serves as a futuristic, cyberpunk-themed landing page for "Project CHI-CHI," a conceptual robotic companion.

The project demonstrates the power of **Human-AI Collaboration**, utilizing **Claude AI** to generate high-fidelity code based on my creative direction and specific prompting strategies.

## 🛠️ Development & Contribution

This project is a result of an iterative prompt-engineering process:

* **Concept & Direction (Me):** I defined the aesthetic (Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi), the layout structure, the color palette (Neon Green/Black), and the specific "SQC" branding requirements.
* **Code Generation (Claude AI):** acted as the coding engine, generating the HTML5 structure and advanced CSS3 animations based on my requirements.
* **Integration:** I assembled the components, fine-tuned the responsiveness, and ensured the "Unleashed" theme fit the induction goals.

## ✨ Key Features

The webpage is built as a **Single File Application** (HTML + CSS + Base64 Image) with no external dependencies.

### 1. Immersive Visuals
* **CRT Scanline Overlay:** A custom CSS overlay (`pointer-events: none`) that mimics the texture of old-school monochrome monitors.
* **3D Infinite Grid:** A background animation using CSS `perspective` and `rotateX` to create a moving, "Tron-like" floor.
* **Neon Typography:** Integrated **Google Fonts** ('Orbitron' and 'Rajdhani') with glowing text-shadow effects.

### 2. Advanced CSS Animations
* **Levitating Asset:** The main Chi-Chi robot image features a floating animation (`@keyframes float`) with a dynamic shadow.
* **Glitch/Blink Effects:** The logo features a retro blinking cursor animation.
* **Interactive HUD:** Hover states on buttons and stats boxes create a tactile, high-tech feel.

### 3. Responsive Design
* **Mobile Adaptive:** The layout automatically stacks and adjusts font sizes for smaller screens (mobile/tablet) using media queries.
* **Corner Accents:** Fixed position elements create a "Heads Up Display" (HUD) frame around the viewport.

## 🚀 How to Run

Since the image is embedded directly into the code (Base64) and there are no external CSS/JS files, deployment is instant:

1.  **Download** the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open** it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Experience** the SQC CHI-CHI interface.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox, Grid, Keyframes, Pseudo-elements.
* **Assets:** Base64 encoded PNG (embedded).
