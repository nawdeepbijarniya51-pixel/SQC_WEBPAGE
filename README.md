🟢 PROJECT: CHI-CHI // SHOWCASE V1.0UNLEASHED - Immersive Cyberpunk Landing Page📂 OverviewSQC - CHI-CHI Showcase is a high-fidelity, single-page web experience designed to introduce "Project CHI-CHI"—a fictional next-generation autonomous robotic companion.This project utilizes advanced CSS3 techniques to create an immersive "terminal" atmosphere, featuring CRT scanlines, 3D perspective grids, neon glow effects, and responsive design, all without the use of external JavaScript libraries.✨ Core Systems (Features)This landing page includes the following visual and technical modules:CRT Scanline Overlay: A fixed pointer-events: none overlay that simulates the texture of old-school monitors.3D Perspective Grid: An infinite scrolling floor grid animated using CSS 3D transforms (rotateX).Neon Typography: Utilizes Google Fonts:'Orbitron' for futuristic, technical headers.'Rajdhani' for crisp, readable body text.Floating Elements: The dog image floats with a subtle CSS animation, complete with a dynamic glowing shadow.Interactive UI: Hover effects on buttons, stat boxes, and navigation items.Responsive Scaling: Media queries adjust font sizes and layouts for smaller terminal displays (mobile).🚀 Initialization Sequence (Setup)To deploy the "CHI-CHI" protocol on your local machine:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/sqc-chichi-showcase.git
cd sqc-chichi-showcase
Execute:Simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your browser.Or serve it using a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code).⚙️ Configuration (Code Breakdown)1. Visual Aesthetics (CSS)The design relies heavily on pseudo-elements (::before) and CSS keyframe animations.Grid Background (.grid-bg):This uses linear-gradient combined with a perspective(500px) transform to create the illusion of depth. The infinite loop is handled by animation: gridMove 20s linear infinite.Corner Accents (.corner-accent):Four absolute positioned divs create the "HUD" bracket effect, enhancing the sci-fi feel without obstructing content.2. TypographyThe project imports fonts directly via Google APIs:CSS@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Orbitron:wght@400;500;700;900&family=Rajdhani:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');
Orbitron: Used for h1, buttons, and navigation.Rajdhani: Used for descriptions (p) and smaller labels.3. Image HandlingCurrently, the dog image is embedded as a Base64 string within the HTML (<img src="data:image/png;base64...">).⚠️ NOTE: For production environments, it is recommended to save the Base64 string as a separate .png file (e.g., chi-chi.png) and link it via src="chi-chi.png" to improve page load speed and reduce HTML file size.🛠️ Customization ProtocolYou can easily modify the theme by targeting the CSS variables (manual find/replace):ElementCurrent ValueDescriptionPrimary Color#00ff00 (Neon Green)The main accent for borders, text shadows, and buttons.Background#000 (Pure Black)The base terminal background.Text Color#fff (White)Primary text color.To change the "Blink" animation speed on the logo:Modify the @keyframes blink duration in the .logo::before style block.📜 LicenseSQC Protocol License: Open Source (MIT).Feel free to fork, modify, and integrate into your own cyberpunk projects.
